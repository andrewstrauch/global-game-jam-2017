# GGJ2017

## Current Work
- FlareVulca - DISCOVERY: Enemy damage the player, figure out "death"
- Icelus - Coding last enemy
- JediSange - - BUG: Collision on bottom right wall is wrong (shoot through wall objects on current Map 1) -- recheck all tiles
- RamielRowe - Track down the light bug
- Zephyrum - Rotate tiles to have up/down/left/right walls

## TODO (Coding)\
- Implemment player lose mechanic
- Level design Map 1
- Shooting Reload functionality
- Shooting Reload UI

## TODO (Art)
- Level end graphic (Stairs)
- Iterate on wall graphics
- Finishing the tile set
- Player graphics
- Enemy graphics (seek Icelus for enemy types?)

## TODO (Music/Sound)
- Enemy sound effect -- breathing (happens as long as enemy is alive)
- Enemy sound effect -- walking (only play if moving, e.g. footsteps)

## Stretch Goals
- Expand on heartbeat to make heartbeat happening at all times
- Rethink fog of war (relates to light bug), can we remove FOW rather than adding white light? art suggestion
- DISCOVERY: Determine if we want traps (and what those would be)

## Collision Channels
- Top left (1) - Colision with tileset
- Bottom Left (1025) - Colision with enemies
